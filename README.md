# glass-cleaning-mechanism
This cleaning system is specifically designed to maintain clear visibility for meteorological observations by removing raindrops from the camera box's glass surface. The motor-driven mechanism efficiently sweeps across the glass, clearing away any rainwater that may obscure the camera's view. using heat and humidity sensor beside a dc motor to drive the cleaning mechanism that will keep the syrface of the glass clean from rain any drops.
# THE LIST OF SENSORS AND ACTUATORS
1-DHT11 humidity and tempreture sensor
2-Wind-shield DC Motor
3-Electronic relay
