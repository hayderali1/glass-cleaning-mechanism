# glass-cleaning-mechanism
This cleaning system is specifically designed to maintain clear visibility for meteorological observations by removing raindrops from the camera box's glass surface. The motor-driven mechanism efficiently sweeps across the glass, clearing away any rainwater that may obscure the camera's view. By adopting this dedicated approach, Project 2 effectively combats rain obstructions, ensuring that meteor surveillance operations can continue uninterrupted even during adverse weather conditions. This targeted solution enhances the reliability and effectiveness of the surveillance system, enabling continuous monitoring of celestial phenomena regardless of external environmental factors
